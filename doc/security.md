# Security for Arch Linux
This document will shortly instruct you how to greatly increase your system security without sacrificing on its ease of use.

> [!NOTE]  
> There's myth that Linux is so secure by default or that there's almost no viruses for this system - **wrong!** Chance of being infected on basic Linux installation is actually higher that on Windows or MacOS.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can make your operating system an ultimate fortress but remember that you're still human and as its administrator you're weakest chain in whole security. It can still fail if you ever execute some suspicious script or application with root access.
